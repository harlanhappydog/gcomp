<div><p>Suppose a general-population survey shows that people who exercise less, weigh more. You don't have any known direction of <em>time</em> in the data - you don't know which came first, the increased weight or the diminished exercise. And you didn't randomly assign half the population to exercise less; you just surveyed an existing population.</p>
<p>The statisticians who discovered causality were trying to find a way to distinguish, within survey data, the direction of cause and effect - whether, as common sense would have it, more obese people exercise less <em>because</em> they find physical activity less rewarding; or whether, as in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world_hypothesis">virtue theory of metabolism</a>, lack of exercise actually <em>causes</em> weight gain due to divine punishment for the sin of sloth.</p>

<p>The usual way to resolve this sort of question is by <em>randomized</em> <em>intervention.</em> If you randomly assign half your experimental subjects to exercise more, and afterward the increased-exercise group doesn't lose any weight compared to the control group&#xA0;<a name="note1back"></a><a href="#note1">[1]</a>, you could rule out causality <em>from</em> exercise <em>to</em> weight, and conclude that the correlation between weight and exercise is probably due to physical activity being less fun when you're overweight <a name="note3back"></a><a href="#note3">[3]</a>. The question is whether you can get causal data <em>without</em> interventions.</p>
<p>For a long time, the conventional wisdom in philosophy was that this was impossible unless you knew the direction of time and knew which event had happened first. Among some philosophers of science, there was a belief that the "direction of causality" was a <em>meaningless</em> question, and that in the universe itself there were <em>only</em> correlations - that "cause and effect" was something unobservable and undefinable, that only unsophisticated non-statisticians believed in due to their lack of formal training:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The law of causality, I believe, like much that passes muster among philosophers, is a relic of a bygone age, surviving, like the monarchy, only because it is erroneously supposed to do no harm." -- Bertrand Russell (he later changed his mind)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Beyond such discarded fundamentals as 'matter' and 'force' lies still another fetish among the inscrutable arcana of modern science, namely, the category of cause and effect." -- Karl Pearson</p>
<p>The famous statistician Fisher, who was also a smoker, testified before Congress that the correlation between smoking and lung cancer couldn't prove that the former caused the latter. &#xA0;We have remnants of this type of reasoning in old-school "Correlation does not imply causation", without the now-standard appendix, "<a href="http://xkcd.com/552/">But it sure is a hint</a>".</p>
<p>This skepticism was overturned by a surprisingly simple mathematical observation.<a id="more"></a></p>
<p>Let's say there are three variables in the survey data: Weight, how much the person exercises, and how much time they spend on the Internet.</p>
<p>For simplicity, we'll have these three variables be binary, yes-or-no observations: Y or N for whether the person has a BMI over 25, Y or N for whether they exercised at least twice in the last week, and Y or N for whether they've checked Reddit in the last 72 hours.</p>
<p>Now let's say our gathered data looks like this:</p>
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Overweight</th> <th>Exercise</th> <th>Internet</th> <th>#</th>

<tr>
<td>Y</td>

<p>And lo, merely by eyeballing this data -</p>
<p>(which is <em>totally made up</em>, so don't go actually <em>believing </em>the conclusion I'm about to draw)</p>
<p>- we now realize that <em>being overweight and spending time on the Internet both cause you to exercise less,</em> presumably because exercise is less fun and you have more alternative things to do,<em> but exercising has no causal influence on body weight or Internet use.</em></p>
<p>"What!" you cry. "How can you tell <em>that</em> just by inspecting those numbers? You can't say that exercise isn't <em>correlated</em> to body weight - if you just look at all the members of the population who exercise, they clearly have lower weights. 10%&#xA0;of exercisers are overweight, vs. 28%&#xA0;of non-exercisers. &#xA0;How could you rule out the obvious causal explanation for that correlation, just by looking at this data?"</p>
<hr>
<p>There's a wee bit of math involved. &#xA0;It's <em>simple</em> math - the part we'll use doesn't involve solving equations or complicated proofs -but we do have to introduce a wee bit of novel math to explain how the heck we got there from here.</p>
<p>Let me start with a question that turned out - to the surprise of many investigators involved - to be highly related to the issue we've just addressed.</p>
<p>Suppose that earthquakes and burglars can both set off burglar alarms. &#xA0;If the burglar alarm in your house goes off, it might be because of an actual burglar, but it might <em>also </em>be because a minor earthquake rocked your house and triggered a few sensors. Early investigators in Artificial Intelligence, who were trying to represent all high-level events using primitive tokens in a first-order logic (for reasons of historical stupidity we won't go into) were stymied by the following apparent paradox:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you tell me that my burglar alarm went off, I infer a burglar, which I will represent in my first-order-logical database using a theorem&#xA0;<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify; ">&#x22A2;</span>&#xA0;ALARM&#xA0;&#x2192;&#xA0;BURGLAR. (The symbol "<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify; ">&#x22A2;</span>" is called "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnstile_(symbol)">turnstile</a>" and means "the logical system asserts that".)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an earthquake occurs, it will set off burglar alarms. I shall represent this using the theorem&#xA0;<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify; ">&#x22A2;</span>&#xA0;EARTHQUAKE&#xA0;&#x2192;&#xA0;ALARM, or "earthquake implies alarm".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you tell me that my alarm went off, and then further tell me that an earthquake occurred, it <em>explains away</em> my burglar alarm going off. I don't need to explain the alarm by a burglar, because the alarm has already been explained by the earthquake. I conclude there was no burglar. I shall represent this by adding a theorem which says&#xA0;<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify; ">&#x22A2;</span>&#xA0;(EARTHQUAKE &amp; ALARM)&#xA0;&#x2192;&#xA0;NOT BURGLAR.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Which represents a logical contradiction, and for a while there were attempts to develop "non-monotonic logics" so that you could retract conclusions given additional data. <a href="/lw/vt/the_nature_of_logic/">This didn't work very well, since the underlying structure of reasoning was a terrible fit for the structure of classical logic, even when mutated.</a></p>
<p>Just changing certainties to quantitative probabilities can fix many problems with classical logic, and one might think that this case was likewise easily fixed.</p>
<p>Namely, just write a probability table of all possible combinations of earthquake or &#xAC;earthquake, burglar or &#xAC;burglar, and alarm or &#xAC;alarm (where&#xA0;&#xAC; is the logical negation symbol), with the following entries:</p>
<table border="1">

<p>Using the operations of <em>marginalization</em> and <em>conditionalization,</em> we get the desired reasoning back out:</p>
<p>Let's start with the <em>probability of a burglar given an alarm,</em> p(burglar|alarm). By the law of conditional probability,</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(b%7Ca)%20=%20%5Cfrac%7Bp(ab)%7D%7Bp(a)%7D" alt="" height="44" width="112"></p>
<p>i.e. the relative fraction of cases where there's an alarm <em>and</em> a burglar, within the set of all cases where there's an alarm.</p>
<p>The table doesn't directly tell us p(alarm &amp; burglar)/p(alarm), but by the law of marginal probability,</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(ab)%20=%20p(abe)%20+%20p(ab%5Cneg%20e)%20=%20.000162%20+%20.0151%20=%20.0153" alt="" height="19" width="405"></p>
<p>Similarly, to get the probability of an alarm going off, p(alarm), we add up all the different sets of events that involve an alarm going off - entries 1, 3, 5, and 7 in the table.</p>
<p>So the entire set of calculations looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If I hear a burglar alarm, I conclude there was probably (63%) a burglar.&#xA0;</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(b%7Ca)%20=%20%5Cfrac%7Bp(ab)%7D%7Bp(a)%7D%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B.0153%7D%7B.000162%20+%20.0151%20+%20.0078%20+%20.00097%7D%20=%20.63" alt="" height="44" width="443"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I learn about an earthquake, I conclude there was probably (80%) an alarm.&#xA0;</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(a%7Ce)%20=%20%5Cfrac%7Bp(ae)%7D%7Bp(e)%7D%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B.000162%20+%20.0078%7D%7B.000162%20+%20.0078%20+%20.0000085%20+%20.002%7D%20=%20.8" alt="" height="44" width="445"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hear about an alarm and then hear about an earthquake; I conclude there was probably (98%) no burglar.&#xA0;</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfrac%7Bp(ae%5Cneg%20b)%7D%7Bp(ae)%7D%20=%20%5Cfrac%7Bp(ae%5Cneg%20b)%7D%7Bp(aeb)%20+%20p(ae%5Cneg%20b)%7D%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B.0078%7D%7B.000162%20+%20.0078%7D%20=%20.98" alt="" height="44" width="417"></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, a joint probability distribution is indeed capable of <em>representing</em> the reasoning-behaviors we want.</p>
<p>So is our problem solved? Our work done?</p>
<p>Not in real life or real Artificial Intelligence work. The problem is that this solution doesn't scale. <em>Boy howdy</em>, does it not scale! If you have a model containing <em>forty</em> binary variables - alert readers may notice that the observed physical universe contains at least forty things - and you try to write out the <em>joint probability distribution</em> over all combinations of those variables, it looks like this:</p>
<table border="1">

<p>(1,099,511,627,776 entries)</p>
<p>This isn't merely a storage problem. In terms of storage, a trillion entries is just a terabyte or three. The real problem is <em>learning</em> a table like that. You have to deduce 1,099,511,627,776 floating-point probabilities from observed data, and the only constraint on this giant table is that all the probabilities must sum to exactly 1.0, a problem with 1,099,511,627,775 degrees of freedom. (If you know the first 1,099,511,627,775 numbers, you can deduce the 1,099,511,627,776th number using the constraint that they all sum to exactly 1.0.) It's not the storage cost that kills you in a problem with forty variables, it's the difficulty of gathering enough observational data to constrain a trillion different parameters. And in a universe containing <em>seventy</em> things, things are even worse.</p>
<p><img src="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/mediawiki/images/b/b3/Boromir.png" alt="" height="325" width="551"></p>
<p>So instead, suppose we approached the earthquake-burglar problem by trying to specify probabilities in a format where... never mind, it's easier to just give an example before stating abstract rules.</p>
<p>First let's add, for purposes of further illustration, a new variable, "Recession", whether or not there's a depressed economy at the time. Now suppose that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The probability of an earthquake is 0.01.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The probability of a recession at any given time is 0.33 (or 1/3).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The probability of a burglary given a recession is 0.04; or, given no recession, 0.01.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An earthquake is 0.8 likely to set off your burglar alarm; a burglar is 0.9 likely to set off your burglar alarm. &#xA0;<em>And </em>- we can't compute this model fully without this info - the combination of a burglar <em>and</em> an earthquake is 0.95 likely to set off the alarm; and in the absence of either burglars or earthquakes, your alarm has a 0.001 chance of going off anyway.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>According to this model, if you want to know "The probability that an earthquake occurs" - just the probability of that one variable, without talking about any others - you can directly look up p(e) = .01. On the other hand, if you want to know the probability of a burglar striking, you have to first look up the probability of a recession (.33), and then p(b|r) and p(b|&#xAC;r), and sum up p(b|r)*p(r) + p(b|&#xAC;r)*p(&#xAC;r) to get a net probability of .01*.66 + .04*.33 = .02 = p(b), a 2% probability that a burglar is around at some random time.</p>
<p>If we want to compute the joint probability of four values for all four variables - for example, the probability that there is no earthquake <em>and</em> no recession<em> and</em> a burglar <em>and</em> the alarm goes off - this causal model computes this joint probability as the product:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(%5Cneg%20e)p(%5Cneg%20r)p(b%7C%5Cneg%20r)p(a%7Cb%5Cneg%20e)%20=%20.99%20*%20.67%20*%20.01%20*%20.9%20=%20.006%20=%200.6%" alt="" height="19" width="470"></p>
<p>In general, to go from a <em>causal model</em> to a <em>probability distribution,</em> we compute, for each setting of all the variables, the product</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(%5Cmathbf%7BX%7D=%5Cmathbf%7Bx%7D)=%20%5Cprod_i%20p(X_i=x_i%7C%5Cmathbf%7BPA_i%7D=%5Cmathbf%7Bpa_i%7D)" alt=""></p>
<p>multiplying together the conditional probability of each variable <em>given the values of its immediate parents.</em>&#xA0; (If a node has no parents, the probability table for it has just an unconditional probability, like "the chance of an earthquake is .01".)</p>
<p>This is a <em>causal</em> model because it corresponds to a world in which each event is <em>directly</em> caused by only a small set of other events, its parent nodes in the graph. In this model, a recession can <em>indirectly</em> cause an alarm to go off - the recession increases the probability of a burglar, who in turn sets off an alarm - but the recession <em>only</em> acts on the alarm through the <em>intermediate cause</em> of the burglar. &#xA0;(Contrast to a model where recessions set off burglar alarms directly.)</p>

<p>The first diagram implies that once we <em>already know</em> whether or not there's a burglar, we don't learn <em>anything more</em> about the probability of a burglar alarm, if we find out that there's a recession:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(a%7Cb)%20=%20p(a%7Cbr)" alt="" height="19" width="122"></p>
<p>This is a fundamental illustration of <em>the locality of causality -</em>&#xA0;once I know there's a burglar, I know <em>everything I need to know</em>&#xA0;to calculate the probability that there's an alarm. &#xA0;Knowing the state of Burglar&#xA0;<em>screens off</em>&#xA0;anything that Recession could tell me about Alarm - even though, if I <em>didn't </em>know the value of the Burglar variable, Recessions would appear to be statistically correlated with Alarms. &#xA0;The present screens off the past from the future; in a causal system, if you know the <em>exact, complete</em> state of the present, the state of the past has no further physical relevance to computing the future. &#xA0;It's how, in a system containing many correlations (like the recession-alarm correlation), it's still possible to compute each variable just by looking at a small number of immediate neighbors.</p>
<p>Constraints like this are also how we can store a causal model - and much more importantly,&#xA0;<em>learn</em>&#xA0;a causal model - with many fewer parameters than the naked, raw, joint probability distribution.</p>
<p>Let's illustrate this using a simplified version of this graph, which only talks about earthquakes and recessions. We could consider three hypothetical causal diagrams over only these two variables:</p>

<p>Let's consider the first hypothesis - that there's no causal arrows connecting earthquakes and recessions. If we build a <em>causal model</em> around this diagram, it has 2 real degrees of freedom - a degree of freedom for saying that the probability of an earthquake is, say, 29% (and hence that the probability of not-earthquake is necessarily 71%), and another degree of freedom for saying that the probability of a recession is 3% (and hence the probability of not-recession is constrained to be 97%).</p>
<p>On the other hand, the full joint probability distribution would have 3 degrees of freedom - a free choice of (earthquake&amp;recession), a choice of p(earthquake&amp;&#xAC;recession), a choice of p(&#xAC;earthquake&amp;recession), and then a constrained p(&#xAC;earthquake&amp;&#xAC;recession) which must be equal to 1 minus the sum of the other three, so that all four probabilities sum to 1.0.</p>
<p>By the pigeonhole principle (you can't fit 3 pigeons into 2 pigeonholes) there must be some joint probability distributions which <em>cannot be represented</em> in the first causal structure. This means the first causal structure is <em>falsifiable;</em> there's survey data we can get which would lead us to reject it as a hypothesis. In particular, the first causal model requires:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(er)%20=%20p(e)p(r)" alt="" height="19" width="126"></p>
<p>or equivalently</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(e%7Cr)%20=%20p(e)" alt=""></p>
<p>or equivalently</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(r%7Ce)%20=%20p(r)" alt="" height="19" width="100"></p>
<p>which is a <em>conditional independence</em> constraint - it says that learning about recessions doesn't tell us anything about the probability of an earthquake or vice versa. If we find that earthquakes and recessions are highly correlated in the observed data - if earthquakes and recessions go together, or earthquakes and the <em>absence</em> of recessions go together - it falsifies the first causal model.</p>
<p>For example, let's say that in your state, an earthquake is 0.1 probable per year and a recession is 0.2 probable. If we suppose that earthquakes don't cause recessions, earthquakes are not an effect of recessions, and that there aren't hidden aliens which produce both earthquakes and recessions, then we should find that years in which there are <em>earthquakes and recessions</em> happen around 0.02 of the time. If instead earthquakes and recessions happen 0.08 of the time, then the probability of a recession <em>given</em> an earthquake is 0.8 instead of 0.2, and we should much more strongly expect a recession any time we are told that an earthquake has occurred. Given enough samples, this falsifies the theory that these factors are unconnected; or rather, the more samples we have, the more we disbelieve that the two events are unconnected.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we can't tell apart the second two possibilities from survey data, because both causal models have 3 degrees of freedom, which is the size of the full joint probability distribution. (In general, <em>fully connected</em> causal graphs in which there's a line between every pair of nodes, have the same number of degrees of freedom as a raw joint distribution - and 2 nodes connected by 1 line are "fully connected".) We can't tell if earthquakes are 0.1 likely and cause recessions with 0.8 probability, or recessions are 0.2 likely and cause earthquakes with 0.4 probability (or if there are hidden aliens which on 6% of years show up and cause earthquakes and recessions with probability 1).</p>
<p>With larger universes, the difference between <em>causal models</em> and <em>joint probability distributions</em> becomes a lot more striking. If we're trying to reason about a million binary variables connected in a huge causal model, and each variable could have up to four direct 'parents' - four other variables that <em>directly</em> exert a causal effect on it - then the total number of free parameters would be at most... 16 million!</p>
<p>The number of free parameters in a raw joint probability distribution over a million binary variables would be 2<sup>1,000,000</sup>. Minus one.</p>
<p>So causal models which are <em>less</em> than fully connected - in which most objects in the universe are not the direct cause or direct effect of everything else in the universe - are very strongly <em>falsifiable;</em> they only allow probability distributions (hence, observed frequencies) in an infinitesimally tiny range of all possible joint probability tables. Causal models very strongly <a href="/lw/i3/making_beliefs_pay_rent_in_anticipated_experiences/">constrain anticipation</a>&#xA0;- disallow almost all possible patterns of observed frequencies - and gain mighty <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/rational/technical">Bayesian advantages</a>&#xA0;when these predictions come true.</p>
<p>To see this effect at work, let's consider the <em>three</em> variables Recession, Burglar, and Alarm. <table border="1">

<p>All three variables seem correlated to each other when considered two at a time. For example, if we consider Recessions and Alarms, they should seem correlated because recessions cause burglars which cause alarms. If we learn there was an alarm, for example, we conclude it's more probable that there was a recession. So since all three variables are correlated, can we distinguish between, say, these three causal models?</p>

<p>Yes we can! Among these causal models, the prediction which only the first model makes, which is not shared by either of the other two, is that <em>once we know whether a burglar is there, </em>we learn nothing <em>more</em> about whether there was an alarm by finding out that there was a recession, since recessions only affect alarms through the intermediary of burglars:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(a%7Cbr)%20=%20p(a%7Cb)" alt="" height="19" width="122"></p>
<p>But the third model, in which recessions directly cause alarms, which only then cause burglars, does <em>not</em> have this property. If I know that a burglar has appeared, it's likely that an alarm caused the burglar - but it's even <em>more</em> likely that there was an alarm, if there was a recession around to cause the alarm! So the third model predicts:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(a%7Cbr)%20%5Cneq%20p(a%7Cb)" alt="" height="19" width="122"></p>
<p>And in the second model, where alarms and recessions both cause burglars, we again don't have the conditional independence. If we know that there's a burglar, then we think that either an alarm or a recession caused it; and if we're told that there's an alarm, we'd conclude it was less likely that there was a recession, since the recession had been explained away.</p>
<p>(This may seem a bit clearer by considering the scenario B-&gt;A&lt;-E, where burglars and earthquakes both cause alarms. If we're told the value of the bottom node, that there was an alarm, the probability of there being a burglar is <em>not</em> independent of whether we're told there was an earthquake - the two top nodes are <em>not</em> conditionally independent <em>once we condition on the bottom node.</em>)</p>
<p>On the other hand, we can't tell the difference between:</p>

<p>using <em>only</em> this data and no other variables, because all three causal structures predict the same pattern of conditional dependence and independence - three variables which all appear mutually correlated, but Alarm and Recession become independent once you condition on Burglar.</p>
<p>Being able to read off patterns of conditional dependence and independence is an art known as "D-separation", and if you're good at it you can glance at a diagram like this...</p>
<p><img src="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/mediawiki/images/2/20/Season.svg" alt="" height="358" width="272"></p>
<p>...and see that, once we already know the Season, whether the Sprinkler is on and whether it is Raining are conditionally independent of each other - if we're told that it's Raining we conclude nothing about whether or not the Sprinkler is on. But if we then further observe that the sidewalk is Slippery, then Sprinkler and Rain become conditionally dependent once more, because if the Sidewalk is Slippery then it is probably Wet and this can be explained by either the Sprinkler or the Rain but probably not both, i.e. if we're told that it's Raining we conclude that it's less likely that the Sprinkler was on.</p>

<p>Do you see where this is going?</p>
<p>"Er," you reply, "Maybe if I had a calculator and ten minutes... you want to just go ahead and spell it out?"</p>
<p>Sure! First, we <em>marginalize</em> over the 'exercise' variable to get the table for just weight and Internet use. We do this by taking the 1,119 people who are YYY, overweight and Reddit users and exercising, and the 11,121 people who are overweight and&#xA0;non-exercising and&#xA0;Reddit users, YNY, and adding them together to get 12,240 total people who are overweight Reddit users:</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>
<p>Well, that suggests that the <em>probability</em> of using Reddit, given that your weight is normal, is the <em>same</em> as the probability that you use Reddit, given that you're overweight. 47,222 out of 334,366 normal-weight people use Reddit, and 12,240 out of 88,376 overweight people use Reddit. That's about 14% either way.</p>
<p>"And so we conclude?"</p>
<p>Well, first we conclude it's not particularly likely that using Reddit causes weight gain, or that being overweight causes people to use Reddit:</p>
<p><img src="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/mediawiki/images/1/15/EY5.svg" alt="">&#xA0;<img src="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/mediawiki/images/4/4a/EY6.svg" alt="" height="160" width="195"></p>
<p>If either of those causal links existed, those two variables should be <em>correlated.</em> We shouldn't find the <em>lack of correlation</em> or <em>conditional independence</em> that we just discovered.</p>
<p>Next, imagine that the real causal graph looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/mediawiki/images/5/55/EY7.svg" alt="" height="160" width="358"></p>
<p>In this graph, exercising <em>causes</em> you to be less likely to be overweight (due to the virtue theory of metabolism), and exercising <em>causes</em> you to spend less time on the Internet (because you have less time for it).</p>
<p>But in this case we should <em>not</em> see that the groups who are/aren't overweight have the same probability of spending time on Reddit. There should be an outsized group of people who are both normal-weight and non-Redditors (because they exercise), and an outsized group of non-exercisers who are overweight and Reddit-using.</p>
<p>So that causal graph is also <em>ruled out</em> by the data, as are others like:</p>
<p><img src="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/mediawiki/images/c/c3/EY8.svg" alt="" height="259" width="195">&#xA0;<img src="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/mediawiki/images/a/a5/EY9.svg" alt="" height="259" width="195">&#xA0;<img src="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/mediawiki/images/0/06/EY18.svg" alt="" height="259" width="195"></p>
<p>&#xA0;</p>
<p>&#xA0;<img src="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/mediawiki/images/5/5e/EY11.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>Leaving <em>only</em> this causal graph:</p>
<p><img src="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/mediawiki/images/6/66/EY12.svg" alt="" height="160" width="358"></p>
<p>Which says that weight and Internet use exert causal effects on exercise, but exercise doesn't causally affect either.</p>
<p>All this discipline was invented and systematized by Judea Pearl, Peter Spirtes, Thomas Verma, and a number of other people in the 1980s and you should be quite impressed by their accomplishment, because before then, inferring causality from correlation was thought to be a fundamentally unsolvable problem. The standard volume on causal structure is <em>Causality</em>&#xA0;by Judea Pearl.</p>
<p>Causal <em>models</em> (with specific probabilities attached) are sometimes known as "Bayesian networks" or "Bayes nets", since they were invented by Bayesians and make use of Bayes's Theorem. They have all sorts of neat computational advantages which are far beyond the scope of this introduction - e.g. in many cases you can split up a Bayesian network into parts, put each of the parts on its own computer processor, and then update on three different pieces of evidence at once using a neatly local message-passing algorithm in which each node talks only to its immediate neighbors and when all the updates are finished propagating the whole network has settled into the correct state. For more on this see Judea Pearl's <em>Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems: Networks of Plausible Inference</em> which is the original book on Bayes nets and still the best introduction I've personally happened to read.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="#note1back"></a><a name="note1"></a>&#xA0;<a href="#note1back">[1]</a> Somewhat to my own shame, I must admit to ignoring my own observations in this department - even after I saw no discernible effect on my weight or my musculature from aerobic exercise and strength training 2 hours a day 3 times a week, I didn't really start believing that the virtue theory of metabolism was <em>wrong&#xA0;<a name="note2back"></a></em><a href="#note2">[2]</a> until after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Taubes">other</a> <a href="http://sethroberts.net/">people</a>&#xA0;had <a href="/lw/mb/lonely_dissent/">started</a> the skeptical dogpile.</p>
<p><a href="#note2back"></a><a name="note2"></a>&#xA0;<a href="#note2back">[2]</a> I should mention, though, that I have confirmed a personal effect where eating <em>enough </em>cookies (at a convention where no protein is available) will cause weight gain afterward. There's no other discernible correlation between my carbs/protein/fat allocations and weight gain, <em>just</em> that eating sweets in large quantities can cause weight gain afterward. This admittedly does bear with the straight-out virtue theory of metabolism, i.e., eating pleasurable foods is sinful weakness and hence punished with fat.</p>
<p><a href="#note3back"></a><a name="note3"></a>&#xA0;<a href="#note3back">[3]</a> Or there might be some hidden third factor, a gene which causes both fat and non-exercise. By Occam's Razor this is more complicated and its probability is penalized accordingly, but we can't actually rule it out. It is obviously impossible to do the converse experiment where half the subjects are randomly assigned lower weights, since there's no known intervention which can cause weight loss.</p>

<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Being able to read off patterns of conditional dependence and independence is an art known as "D-separation", and if you're good at it you can glance at a diagram like this...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to get better at this, I recommend downloading and playing around with <a href="http://unbbayes.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">UnBBayes</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExlfjBQfvMk" rel="nofollow">Here&#39;s</a> a brief video tutorial of the basic usage. The program is pretty buggy - for example, sometimes it randomly refuses to compile a file and then starts working after I close the file and reopen it - but that's more of a trivial inconvenience than a major problem.</p>
<p>What's great about UnBBayes is that it allows you to construct a network and then show how the probability flows around it; you can also force some variable to be true or false and see how this affects the surrounding probabilities. For example, here I've constructed a copy of the "Season" network from the post, filled it with conditional probabilities I made up, and asked the program to calculate the overall probabilities. (This was no tough feat - it took me maybe five minutes, most of which I spent on making up the probabilities.)</p>
<p><a href="http://kajsotala.fi/Random/UnBBayesExample1.png" rel="nofollow">http://kajsotala.fi/Random/UnBBayesExample1.png</a></p>
<p>Let's now run through Eliezer's explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...and see that, once we already know the Season</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, we know the season: let's say that we know it's fall. I tell the program to assume that it's fall, and ask it to propagate the effects of this throughout the network. We can see how this changes the probabilites of the different variables:</p>
<p><a href="http://kajsotala.fi/Random/UnBBayesExample2.png" rel="nofollow">http://kajsotala.fi/Random/UnBBayesExample2.png</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>whether the Sprinkler is on and whether it is Raining are conditionally independent of each other - if we're told that it's Raining we conclude nothing about whether or not the Sprinkler is on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The wording here is a little ambiguous, but Eliezer's saying that with our knowledge of the season, the variables of "Sprinkler" and "Rain" have become independent. Finding out that it rains shouldn't change the probability of the sprinkler being on. Let's test this by setting it to rain and again propagating the effects:</p>
<p><a href="http://kajsotala.fi/Random/UnBBayesExample3.png" rel="nofollow">http://kajsotala.fi/Random/UnBBayesExample3.png</a></p>
<p>And indeed, the probability of it being wet increased, but the probability of the sprinkler being on didn't change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But if we then further observe that the sidewalk is Slippery, then Sprinkler and Rain become conditionally dependent once more, because if the Sidewalk is Slippery then it is probably Wet and this can be explained by either the Sprinkler or the Rain but probably not both, i.e. if we're told that it's Raining we conclude that it's less likely that the Sprinkler was on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So let's put the sidewalk to "slippery", and unset "rain" again. I've defined the network so that the sidewalk is never slippery unless it's wet, so setting the sidewalk to "slippery" forces the probability of "wet" to 100%.</p>
<p><a href="http://kajsotala.fi/Random/UnBBayesExample4.png" rel="nofollow">http://kajsotala.fi/Random/UnBBayesExample4.png</a></p>
<p>Now let's see the effect on probabilities if we set it to rain - as Eliezer predicted, the probability of the sprinkler then goes down:</p>
<p><a href="http://kajsotala.fi/Random/UnBBayesExample5.png" rel="nofollow">http://kajsotala.fi/Random/UnBBayesExample5.png</a></p>
<p>And vice versa, if we force the sprinkler to be on, the probability of it raining goes down:</p>
<p><a href="http://kajsotala.fi/Random/UnBBayesExample6.png" rel="nofollow">http://kajsotala.fi/Random/UnBBayesExample6.png</a></p>
<p>(It occurs to me that even if the sidewalk wasn't wet, it could be slippery if it was covered by leaves, or with ice. So there should actually be an arrow from "season" to "slippery". That would be trivial to add.)</p>
<p>Another great thing about UnBBayes is that it not only helps you understand the direction of the probability flows, but also the magnitude of different kinds of changes. Depending on how you've set up the conditional probabilities, a piece of information can have a huge impact on another variable (the sidewalk being slippery always forces the probability of "wet" to 100%, regardless of anything else), or a rather minor one (when we already knew that it was fall and slippery, finding out that it rained only budged the probability of the sprinkler by about five percentage points). Eventually, the logic starts to become intuitive.</p>
<p>Build your own networks and play around with them!</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>After reading this post I was stunned. Now I think the central conclusion is wrong, though I still think it is a great post, and I will go back to being stunned if you convince me the conclusion is correct.</p>
<p>You've shown how to identify the correct graph structure from the data. But you've erred in assuming that the directed edges of the graph imply causality.</p>
<p>Imagine you did the same analysis, except instead of using O="overweight" you use W="wears size 44 or higher pants". The data would look almost the same. So you would reach an analogous conclusion: that wearing large pants causes one not to exercise. This seems obviously false unless your notion of causality is very different from mine.</p>
<p>In general, I think the following principle holds: <em>inferring causality requires an intervention; it cannot be discovered from observational data alone</em>. A researcher who hypothesized that W causes not-E could round up a bunch of people, have half of them wear big pants, observe the effect of this intervention on exercise rates, and then conclude that there is no causal effect.</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>You are correct -- directed edges do not imply causality by means of only conditional independence tests. You need something called the faithfulness assumption, and additional (causal) assumptions, that Eliezer glossed over. Without causal assumptions and with only faithfulness, all you are recovering is the structure of a statistical, rather than a causal model. Without faithfulness, conditional independence tests do not imply anything. This is a subtle issue, actually.</p>
<p>There is no magic -- you do not get causality without causal assumptions.</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>Even if you assume that we can do induction (and assume faithfulness!), conditional independence tests simply do not select among causal models. They select among statistical models, because conditional independences are properties of joint distributions (statistical, rather than causal objects). Linking those joint distributions with something causal relies on causal assumptions.</p>
<p>I think the biggest lesson to learn from Pearl's book is to keep statistical and causal notions separate.</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>He addressed that in the <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/ev3/causal_diagrams_and_causal_models/#note3">third footnote</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Or there might be some hidden third factor, a gene which causes both fat and non-exercise. By Occam's Razor this is more complicated and its probability is penalized accordingly, but we can't actually rule it out. It is obviously impossible to do the converse experiment where half the subjects are randomly assigned lower weights, since there's no known intervention which can cause weight loss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The model assumes that those are the only relevant variables. Given that assumption, we can prove that weight causes exercise. And that it can't be the other way around.</p>
<p>If there are unobserved variables, it's possible that they can cause weight and cause exercise. However that wasn't one of the hypotheses anyone believed beforehand; they were arguing whether weight causes exercise or if exercise causes weight.</p>
<p>Second, even if there is an unobserved variable, it still suggests that exercising more will not improve your weight. Otherwise internet use would correlate with weight. Because internet use affects exercise. If exercise affected weight at all, then internet use would indirectly cause weight gain, and therefore correlate with it.</p>
<p>The whole point of the article is about this trick. Where taking a weird and unrelated variable like internet use, lets us discover the direction of causation. Which according to common knowledge about statistics, shouldn't be possible. Not without randomized controlled experiments.</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>Hi Eliezer,</p>
<p>Thanks for writing this! A few comments about this article (mostly minor, with one exception).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The famous statistician Fischer, who was also a smoker, testified before Congress that the correlation between smoking and lung cancer couldn't prove that the former caused the latter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fisher was specifically worried about hidden common causes. Fisher was also the one who brought the concept of a randomized experiment into statistics. Fisher was "curmudgeony," but it is not quite fair to use him as an exemplar of the "keep causality out of our statistics" camp.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Causal models (with specific probabilities attached) are sometimes known as "Bayesian networks" or "Bayes nets", since they were invented by Bayesians and make use of Bayes's Theorem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Graphical causal models and Bayesian networks are not the same thing (this is a common misconception). A distribution that factorizes according to a DAG is a Bayesian network (this is just a property of a distribution -- nothing about causality). You can further say that a graphical model is causal if an additional set of properties holds. For example, you can (loosely) say that in a causal model all parents are "direct causes." If you want to say that formally, you would talk about the truncated factorization and do(.). Without interventions there is no interventionist causal model.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All this discipline was invented and systematized by Judea Pearl, Peter Spirtes, Thomas Verma, and a number of other people in the 1980s and you should be quite impressed by their accomplishment, because before then, inferring causality from correlation was thought to be a fundamentally unsolvable problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I often find myself in a weird position of having to point folks to people other than Pearl. I think it's commendable that you looked into other people in the field. The big early names in causality that you did not mention are Haavelmo (1950s) and Sewall Wright (this guy is amazing -- he figured so many things out correctly in the 1920s). Special cases of non-causal graphical models (Ising models, Hidden Markov models, etc.), along with factorizations and propagation algorithms were known long before Pearl in other communities.</p>
<hr />
<p>P.S. Since I am in Cali.: if folks at SI are interested in new developments on the "learning causal structure from data" front, I could be bribed by the Cheeseboard to come by and give a talk.</p></div>

<p>I recall reading some lovely quote on this (from somebody of the old camp, who believed that talk of 'causality' was naive), but I couldn't track it down in Pearl or on Google - if anyone knows of a good quote from the old school, may it be provided.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe it's this one?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The law of causality, I believe, like much that passes muster among philosophers, is a relic of a bygone age, surviving, like the monarchy, only because it is erroneously supposed to do no harm. (Russell, 1913, p. 1).</p>

<p>there are a number of words that could replace X in that sentence to produce something that would be considered a standard LW position. Are we making a similar mistake, i.e., assuming that just because we don't yet have a satisfactory theory of X that no such theory can exist?</p></div>

<p>Agreed, the evidence for the presence of X is that humans have been talking about it for a long time and seem to mean something.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Especially if the work a theory of X is supposed to do can be done without a theory of X, or turn out not to be necessary in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Careful, it's very easy to convince oneself that one doesn't need a theory of X when one is actually hiding X behind <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Cached_thought">cached thoughts</a> and <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/ny/sneaking_in_connotations/">sneaked in connotations</a>. For example, Russell no doubt believed that he didn't need a theory of causality to do the work the theory of causality was supposed to do.</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>This is absolutely incredible. As a broadly numerate person who's never studied stats, I literally did not know that this could be done and while I'd heard about ways to work out what caused what from statistical information I thought they had to have far more assumptions in them. I'm slightly distressed that I studied A level Maths and don't know this, given that the concept at least can be taught in twenty minutes judging by the post and is massively open to testing (I thought this post didn't make sense at first and that there were other interpretations of the data, but when I expressed those in the terminology set out it because clear I was wrong.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That's a clear outline of the theory. I just want to note that the theory itself makes some assumptions about possible patterns of causation, even before you begin to select which causal graphs are plausible candidates for testing. Pearl himself stresses that without putting causal information in, you can't get causal information out from purely observational data.</p>
<p>For example, if overweight causes lack of exercise and lack of exercise causes overweight, you don't have an acyclic graph. Acyclicity of causation is one of the background assumptions here. Acyclicity of causation is reasonable when talking about point events in a universe without time-like loops. However, "weight" and "exercise level" are temporally extended processes, which makes acyclicity a strong assumption.</p></div>

<p>Our instincts are just wired to interpret causality that way, and that makes it a brute fact.

</blockquote>
<p>That would be a non-explanation, but a better explanation is in fact possible. You can look at the way that light is turned into neural signals by the eye, and discover the existence of red-green, blue-yellow, and light-dark axes, and there you have physiological justification for six of our basic colour words. (I don't know just how settled that story is, but it's settled enough to be literally <a href="http://courses.washington.edu/psych333/handouts/coursepack/ch14-Color_vision.pdf" rel="nofollow">textbook stuff</a>.)</p>
<p>So, that is what a real explanation looks like. Attributing anything to "human nature" is even more wrong than attributing it to "God". At least we have some idea of what "God" would be if he existed, but "human nature" is a blank, a label papering over a void. How do Sebastian Thrun's cars drive themselves? Because he has integrated self-driving into their nature. How does opium produce sleep? By its dormitive nature. How do humans distinguish colours? By their human nature.</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>My answer:</p>
<p>First, notice a situation that occurs many times. Then pay attention to the ways in which things are different from one iteration to the next. At this point, and here is where causal information begins, if some of the variables represent your own behavior, you can systematically intervene in the situation by changing those behaviors. For cleanest results, contrive a controlled experiment that is analogous the the original situation.</p>
<p>In short, you insert causal information by intervening.</p>
<p>This of course requires you to construct a reference class of situations that are substantially similar to one another, but humans seem to be pretty good at that within our domains of familiarity.</p>
<hr />
<p>By the way, thank you for explaining the underlying assumption of acyclicity. I've been trying to internalize the math of causal calculus and it bugged me that cyclic causes weren't allowed. Now I understand that it is a simplification and that the calculus isn't quite as powerful as I thought.</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>I don't have an answer to my own koan, but this was one of the possibilities that I thought of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In short, you insert causal information by intervening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But how does one intervene? By causing some variable to take some value, while obstructing the other causal influences on it. So causal knowledge is already required before one can intervene. This is not a trivial point -- if the knowledge is mistaken, the intervention may not be successful, as I pointed out with the example of <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/ek/without_models/">trying to warm a room thermostat by placing a candle near it</a>.</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>Causal knowledge is required to ensure success, but not to stumble across it. Over time, noticing (or stumbling across if you prefer) relationships between the successes stumbled upon can quickly coalesce into a model of how to intervene. Isn't this essentially how we believe causal reasoning originated? In a sense, all DNA is information about how to intervene that, once stumbled across, persisted due to its efficacy.</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>Yes, the Occamian view is in his book in section 2.3 (and still in the 2009 2nd edition). But that definition of "inferred causation" -- those arrows common to all causal models consistent with the statistical data -- depends on general causal assumptions, the usual ones being the DAG, Markov, and Faithfulness properties.</p>
<p>In other places, for example: <a href="http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r350.pdf" rel="nofollow">&quot;Causal inference in statistics: An overview&quot;</a>, which is in effect the Cliff Notes version of his book, he writes:</p>
<p>"one cannot substantiate causal claims from associations alone, even at the population level -- behind every causal conclusion there must lie some causal assumption that is not testable in observational studies."</p>
<p><a href="http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/Test_pea-final.pdf" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a similar survey article from 2003, in which he writes that exact sentence, followed by:</p>
<p>"Nancy Cartwright (1989) expressed this principle as "no causes in, no causes out", meaning that we cannot convert statistical knowledge into causal knowledge."</p>
<p>Everywhere, he defines causation in terms of counterfactuals: claims about what would have happened had something been different, which, he says, cannot be expressed in terms of statistical distributions over observational data. <a href="http://stephenibaraki.com/acm/interviews/v0412/judea_pearl_acm.html" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a long interview (both audio and text transcript) in which he recounts the whole course of his work.</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>I don't think that Bayesian networks implicitly contain the concept of causality.</p>
<p>Formally, a probability distribution is represented by a Bayesian network if it can be factored as a product of P(node | node's parents). But this is not unique, given one network you can create lots of other networks which also represent the same distribution by e.g. changing the direction of arrows as long as the independence properties from the graph stay the same (e.g. the graphs A -&gt; B -&gt; C and A &lt;- B &lt;- C can represent exactly the same class of probability distributions). Pearl distinguishes Baysian networks from <em>causal</em> networks, which are Bayesian networks in which the arrows point in the direction of causality.</p>
<p>And of course, there are other sparse representations like Markov networks, which also incorporates independence assumptions but are undirected.</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>The non-uniqueness doesn't make causality absent or irrelevant; it must means there are multiple minimal representations that use causality.

<p>There are indeed equivalent models that use purely symmetric node connections (or none at all in the case of the superexponential pair wise conditional independence table across all variables), but (correct me if I'm wrong) by throwing away the information graphically represented by the arrows, you no longer have a maximally efficient encoding of the joint probability distribution (even though it's certainly not as bad as the superexponential table).</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>I guess there are two points here.</p>
<p>First, authors like Pearl do not use "causality" to mean just that there is a directed edge in a Bayesian network (i.e. that certain conditional independence properties hold). Rather, he uses it to mean that the model describes what happens under interventions. One can see the difference by comparing Rain -&gt; WetGrass with WetGrass -&gt; Rain (which are equivalent as Bayesian networks). Of course, maybe he is confused and the difference will dissolve under more careful consideration, but I think this shows one should be careful in claiming that Bayes networks encode our best understanding of causality.</p>
<p>Second, do we need Bayesian networks to economically represent distributions? This is slightly subtle.</p>
<p>We do not need the directed arrows when representing a particular distribution. For example, suppose a distribution P(A,B,C) is represented by the Bayesian network A -&gt; B &lt;- C. Expanding the definition, this means that the joint distribution can be factored as</p>
<p>P(A=a,B=b,C=c) = P1(A=a) P2(B=b|A=a,C=c) P3(C=c)</p>
<p>where P1 and P3 are the marginal distributions of A and B, and P2 is the conditional distribution of B. So the data we needed to specify P were two one-column tables specifying P1 and P3, and a three-column table specifying P2(a|b,c) for all values of a,b,c. But now note that we do not gain very much by knowing that these are probability distributions. To save space it is enough to note that P factors as</p>
<p>P(A=a,B=b,C=c) = F1(a) F2(b,a,c) F3(c)</p>
<p>for some real-valued functions F1, F2, and F3. In other words, that P is represented by a Markov network A - B - C. The directions on the edges were not essential.</p>
<p>And indeed, typical algorithms for inference <em>given</em> a probability distribution, such as belief propagation, do not make use of the Bayesian structure. They work equally well for directed and undirected graphs.</p>
<p>Rather, the point of Bayesian versus Markov networks is that the class of probability distributions that can be represented by them are different. So they are useful when we try to <em>learn</em> a probability distribution, and want to cut down the search space by constraining the distribution by some independence relations that we know a priori.</p>
<p>Bayesian networks are popular because they let us write down many independence assumptions that we know hold for practical problems. However, we then have to ask how we know those particular independence relations hold. And that's because they correspond to causual relations! The reason Bayesian networks are popular with human researchers is that they correspond well with the notion of causality that humans use. We don't know that the Armchairians would also find them useful.</p></div>

</blockquote>
<p>I think this is right, if you know that the factors were learned by fitting them to a Bayesian network, you can recover what that network must have been. And you can go even further, if you only have a joint distribution you can use the techniques of the original article to see which Bayesian networks could be consistent with it.</p>
<p>But there is a separate question about why we are interested in Bayesian networks in the first place. SilasBarta seemed to claim that you are naturally led to them if you are interested in representing probability distributions efficiently. But for that purpose (I claim), you only need the idea of factors, not the directed graph structure. E.g. a probability distribution which fits the (equivalent) Bayesian networks A -&gt; B -&gt; C or A &lt;- B &lt;- C or A &lt;- B -&gt; C can be efficiently represented as F1(a,b) F2(b,c). You would not think of representing it as F1(a) F2(a,b) F3(b,c) unless you were already interested in causality.</p></div>

<p>On the contrary, they are important and store information about the relationships that saves you time and space. Like I said in my linked comment, the direction of the arrows between A,C and B tell you whether conditioning on B (perhaps by separating it out into buckets of various values) creates or destroys mutual information between A and C. That saves you from having to explicitly write out all the combinations of conditional (in)dependence.</p></div>

<p>Oops, on second thought the factorization is equivalent to the complete triangle, not a line. But this doesn't change the point that the space requirements are determined by the factors, not the graph structure, so the two representations will use the same amount of space.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the contrary, they are important and store information about the relationships that saves you time and space.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All independence relations are implicit in the distribution itself, so the graph can only save you time, not space.</p>
<p>It is true that knowing a minimal Bayes network or a minimal Markov network for a distribution lets you read of certain independence assumptions quickly. But it doesn't save you from having to write out <em>all</em> the combinations. There are exponentially many possible conditional independences, each of which may hold or not, so no sub-exponential representation can get encode all of them. And indeed, there are some kinds of independence assumptions that can be expressed as Bayesian networks but not Markov networks, and vice versa. Even in everyday machine learning, it is not the case that Bayesian networks is always the best representation.</p>
<p>You also do not motivate why someone would be interested in a big list of conditional independencies for its own sake. Surely, what we ultimately want to know is e.g. the probability that it will rain tomorrow, not whether or not rain is correlated with sprinklers.</p></div>

<p>Yes, the question was what they would care about if they were only interested in predictions. And so I think I've motivated why they would care about conditional (in)dependencies: it determines the (minimal) set of variables they need to look at! Whatever minimal method of representing their knowledge will then have these arrows (from one of the networks that fits the data).</p>
<p>If you require that causality definitions be restricted to (uncorrelated) counterfactual operations (like Pearl's "do" operation), then sure, the Armcharians won't do that specific computation. But if you use the definition of causality from this article, then I think it's clear that efficiency considerations will lead them to use something isomorphic to it.</p></div>

<p>No! Once you have learned a distribution using Bayesian network-based methods, the minimal representation of it is the set of factors. You don't need the direction of the arrows any more.</p></div>

<p>I recommend that Eliezer edit this post to remove this kind of provocation. The nature of the actual rationality message in this post is such that people are likely to link to it in the future (indeed, I found it via an external link myself). It even seems like something that may be intended to be part of a sequence. As it stands I expect many future references to be derailed and also expect to see this crop up prominently in lists of reasons to not take Eliezer's blog posts seriously. And, frankly, this reason would be a heck of a lot better than most others that are usually provided by detractors.</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>Maybe the "mainstream status" section should be placed at the top? It would signal right at the top that this post is backed by proper authority.</p>
<p>In addition to the provocation you mention, openly bashing mainstream philosophy in the fourth paragraph doesn't help. If you add a possible reputation of holding unsubstantiated whacky beliefs, well…</p>
<p>That said, I was quite surprised by the number of comments about this issue. I for one didn't see any problem with this post.</p>
<p>When I read "divine punishment for the sin of sloth", I just smiled at the supernatural explanation, knowing that Eliezer <em>of course</em> knows the virtue theory of metabolism have a perfectly natural (and reasonable sounding) explanation. Actually, it didn't even touched my model of his probability distribution of the veracity of the "virtue" theory —nor my own. After having read so much of his writings, I just can't believe he rules such a hypothesis out <em>a priori</em>. <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/tv/excluding_the_supernatural/">Remember</a> <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/tw/psychic_powers/">reductionism</a>. And my model of him definitely does not expect to influence LessWrong readers with an unsubstantiated mockery.</p>
<p>Also, this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And lo, merely by eyeballing this data -</p>
<p>(which is totally made up, so don't go actually <em>believing</em> the conclusion I'm about to draw)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>made clear he wasn't discussing the object at all. It was then easier for me to put myself in a position of total uncertainty regarding the causal model implied by this "data". The same way my HPMOR anticipations are no longer build on cannon —Bellatrix could <em>really</em> be innocent, for al I know.</p>
<p>But this is me assuming total good faith from Eliezer. I totally forgot that many people in fact do not assume good faith.</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>I mostly liked the post. In Pearl's book, the example of whether smoking causes cancer worked pretty well for me despite being potentially controversial, and was more engaging for being on a controversial topic. Part of that is he kept his example fairly cleanly hypothetical. Eliezer's "I didn't really start believing that the virtue theory of metabolism was wrong" in a footnote, and "as common sense would have it" in the main text, both were suggesting it was about the real world. I think in Pearl's example, he may have even made his hypothetical data give the opposite result to the real world.</p>
<p>This post I also thought was more engaging due to the controversial topic, so if you can keep that while reducing the "mind-killer politics" potential I'd encourage that.</p>
<p>I was fine with the model he was falsifying being simple and easily disproved - that's great for an example.</p>
<p>I'm kind of confused and skeptical at the bit at the end: we've ruled out all the models except one. From Pearl's book I'd somehow picked up that we need to make some causal assumption, statistical data wasn't enough to get all the way from ignorance to knowing the causal model.</p>
<p>Is assuming "causation would imply correlation" and "the model will have only these three variables" enough in this case?</p></div>

<p>He introduces a "hypothetical data set," works through the math, then follows the conclusion that tar deposits protect against cancer with this paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The data in Table 3.1 are obviously unrealistic and were deliberately crafted so as to support the genotype theory. However, the purpose of this exercise was to demonstrate how reasonable qualitative assumptions about the workings of mechanisms, coupled with nonexperimental data, can produce precise quantitative assessments of causal effects. In reality, we would expect observational studies involving mediating variables to refute the genotype theory by showing, for example, that the mediating consequences of smoking (such as tar deposits) tend to increase, not decrease, the risk of cancer in smokers and nonsmokers alike. The estimand of (3.29) could then be used for quantifying the causal effect of smoking on cancer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I read it, I remember being mildly bothered by the example (why not have a clearly fictional example to match clearly fictional data, or find an actual study and use the real data as an example?) but mostly mollified by his extended disclaimer.</p>
<p>(I feel like pointing out, as another example, the decision analysis class that I took, which had a central example which was repeated and extended throughout the semester. The professor was an active consultant, and could have drawn on a wealth of examples in, say, petroleum exploration. But the example was a girl choosing a location for a party, subject to uncertain weather. Why that? Because it was obviously a toy example. If they tried to use a petroleum example for petroleum engineers, the petroleum engineers would be rightly suspicious of any simplified model put in front of them- "you mean this procedure only takes into account two things!?"- and any accurate model would be far too complicated to teach the methodology. An obviously toy example taught the process, and then once they understood the process, they were willing to apply it to more complicated situations- which, of course, needed much more complicated models.)</p></div>

<p>How did you ascertain possible effects on your musculature? If you used the inter-ocular trauma test, keep in mind that gradual changes in something you look at every day (e.g. yourself, a roommate, or a classmate/coworker) are much harder to discern that way. Did you try asking someone who hadn't seen you in a while, or comparing two photos of you taken a couple months apart?</p></div>

<p>His observation "only those who find exercise possible or rewarding report regularly exercising" is indeed powerful, obvious, and neglected. There's a prevailing imputation of virtue to physical fitness and sloth to those who lack it, so real thinking is scarce.</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>This slammed into my "math is hard" block. I will return and read it, but it's going to be work.</p>
<p>But on pondering that, I think I realized <em>why</em> math is hard, compared to prose text that just presents itself as a fait accompli to my attention. (And why it is not hard, for some people who are savants.)</p>
<p>We are not <em>executing</em> mathematical computations. We are <em>emulating</em> a crude mathematical computer which takes the kind of explicit algorithms that are fed to students. No attempt is made to cultivate and tune a "feel" for the result (which is what executing computations would be like, since it's what the other hard computations we do - like reading - feel like).</p>
<p>Just putting that out there.</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>It seems clear to me that it is a very <em>bad</em> example. I find that consistently the worst part of Eliezer's non-fiction writing is that he fails to separate contentious claims from writings on unrelated subjects. Moreover, he usually discards the traditional view as ridiculous rather than admitting that its incorrectness is extremely non-obvious. He goes so far in this piece as to give the standard view a straw-man name and to state only the most laughable of its proponents' justifications. This mars an otherwise excellent piece and I am unwilling to recommend this article to those who are not already reading LW.</p></div>

</blockquote>
<p>Of course not! The real reason drinkers cause more accidents is that low-conscientiousness people are both more likely to drink before driving and more likely to drive recklessly. (The impairment of reflexes due to alcohol does itself have an effect, but it's not much larger than that due to e.g. sleep deprivation.) If a high-conscientiousness person was randomly assigned to the “drunk driving” condition, they would drive extra cautiously to compensate for their impairment. ;-)</p>
<p>(I'm exaggerating for comical effect, but I do believe a weaker version of this.)</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>I agree that focusing on input has far higher returns than focusing on output. Simple calorie comparison predicts it, and in my personal experience I've noted small appearance and weight changes after changes in exercise level and large appearance and weight changes after changes in intake level. That said, the traditional view- "eat less and exercise more"- has the direction of causation mostly right for both interventions and to represent it as just "exercise more" seems mistaken.</p></div>

<p>It induces genuine curiosity about the truth</p>

<p>I suspect this depends on the handling of the issue. Eliezer presenting his model of the world as "common sense," straw manning the alternative, and then using fake data that backs up his preferences is, frankly, embarrassing.</p>
<p>This is especially troublesome because this is an introductory explanation to a technical topic- something Eliezer has <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/rational/bayes" rel="nofollow">done well before</a>- and introductory explanations are great ways to introduce people to Less Wrong. But how can I send this to people I know who will notice the bias in the second paragraph and stop reading because that's negative evidence about the quality of the article? How can I send this to people I know who will ask why he's using two time-variant variables as single acyclic nodes, rather than a ladder (where exercise and weight at t-1 both cause exercise at t and weight at t)?</p>
<p>What would it look like to steel man the alternative? One of my physics professors called 'calories in-calories out=change in fat' the "physics diet," since it was rooted in conservation of energy; that seems like a far better name. Like many things in physics, it's a good first order approximation to the engineering reality, but there are meaningful second order terms to consider. "Calories in" is properly "calories absorbed" not "calories put into your mouth"- though we'll note it's difficult to absorb more calories than you put into your mouth. Similarly, calories out is non-trivial to measure- current weight and activity level can give you a broad guess, but it can be complicated by many things, like ambient temperature! Any attempt we make to control calories in and calories out will have to be passed through the psychology and physiology of the person in question, making them even more difficult to control in the field.</p>

<p>Why do you need to send this article to people who could ask that? If you're saying "Oh, this should actually be modeled using causal markov chains..." then this is probably too basic for you.</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>I'm torn. On the one hand, using the method to explain something the reader probably was not previously aware of is an awesome technique that I truly appreciate. Yet Vaniver's point that controversial opinions should not be unnecessarily put into introductory sequence posts makes sense. It might turn off readers who would otherwise learn from the text, like <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/ev3/causal_diagrams_and_causal_models/7mdy">nyan sandwich</a>.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the best fix would be to steelman the argument as much as possible. Call it the physics diet, not the virtue-theory of metabolism. Add in an extra few sentences that really buff up the basics of the physics diet argument. And, at the end, include a note explaining why the physics diet doesn't work (appetite increases as exercise increases).</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>The point Eliezer is addressing is the one that RichardKennaway <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/ev3/causal_diagrams_and_causal_models/7m81">brought up separately</a>. Causal models can still function with feedback (in Causality, Pearl works through an economic model where price and quantity both cause each other, and have their own independent causes), but it's a bit more bothersome.</p>
<p>A model where the three are one-time events- like, say, whether a person has a particular gene, whether or not they were breastfed, and their height as an adult- won't have the problem of being cyclic, but will have the pedagogical problem that the causation is obvious from the timing of the events.</p>
<p>One could have, say, the weather witch's prediction of whether or not there will be rain, whether or not you brought an umbrella with you, and whether or not it rained. Aside from learning, this will be an acyclic system that has a number of plausible underlying causal diagrams (with the presence of the witch making the example clearly fictional and muddying our causal intuitions, so we can only rely on the math).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my opinion, the best fix would be to steelman the argument as much as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The concept of <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/kg/expecting_short_inferential_distances/">inferential distance</a> suggests to me that posts should try and make their pathways as short and straight as possible. Why write a double-length post that explains both causal models and metabolism, when you could write a single-length post that explains only causal models? (And, if metabolism takes longer to discuss than causal models, the post will mostly be about the illustrative detour, not the concept itself!)</p></div>

</blockquote>
<p>“Physics diet” and “virtue-theory of metabolism” are <em>not</em> steelman and strawman of each other; they are quite different things. Proponents of the physics diet (e.g. <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/" rel="nofollow">John Walker</a>) do <em>not</em> say that if you want to lose weight you should exercise more -- they say you should eat less. EDIT: the strawman of this would be the theory that “excessive eating actually causes weight gain due to divine punishment for the sin of gluttony” (inspired by <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/ev3/causal_diagrams_and_causal_models/7mfv">Yvain&#39;s comment</a>).</p>
<p>Seriously; that was intended to be an <em>example</em>. What's it matter whether the nodes are labelled “exercise/overweight/internet” or “foo/bar/baz”? (But yeah, Footnote 1 doesn't belong there, and Footnote 3 might mention eating.)</p></div>

<p>I understand. I think it's important to watch out for these sorts of illusions of transparency, though, especially when dealing with pedagogical material. One of the heuristics I've been using is "who would I not recommend this to?", because that will use social modules my brain is skilled at using to find holes and snags in the article. I don't know how useful that heuristic will be to others, and welcome the suggestion of others.</p>

<p>I am not an expert in nutritional science, but it appears to me that there is <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/7ga/the_carbohydrate_hypothesis_of_obesity_a_critical/">controversy</a> among good nutritionists. <a href="http://gettingstronger.org/2011/11/obesity-starts-in-the-brain-2/" rel="nofollow">This post</a> also aided my understanding of the issue. I also detail some more of my understanding in <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/ev3/causal_diagrams_and_causal_models/7mcv">this comment down another branch</a>.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, doing some more poking around now, <a href="http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2012/09/calories-and-carbohydrate-natural.html#more" rel="nofollow">this</a> seems relevant.</p></div>

<p>You thinking of this maybe, quoted in the <em>Epilogue</em> in Pearl's <em>Causality</em>?</p>

<div class="md"><p>That post is slow to reach its point and kind of abrasive. Here's summary with a different flavor.</p>
<p>Output is set by some Stuff and a Control signal. Agent with full power over Control and accurate models of Output and Stuff can negate the influence of Stuff, making Output whatever it wants, within the range of possible Outputs given Stuff. Intuitively Agent is setting Output via Control, even though there won't be a correlation if Agent is keeping Output constant. I'm not so sure whether it still makes sense to say, even intuitively, that Stuff is a causal parent of Output when the agent trumps it.</p>
<p>Then we break the situation a little. Suppose a driver is keeping a car's speed constant with a gas pedal. You can make the Agent's beliefs inaccurate (directly, by showing the driver a video of an upcoming hill when there is none in front of the car, or by intervening on Stuff, like introducing a gust of wind the driver can't see, and then just not updating Agent's belief). Likewise you can make Agent partially impotent (push down the driver's leg on the gas pedal, give them a seizure, replace them with an octopus). Finally you can change what apparent values and causal relations the agent wants to enforce ("Please go faster").</p>
<p>And those are maybe how you test for consequentialist confounding in real life? You can set environment variables if the agent doesn't anticipate you, or you can find that agent and make them beleive noise, break their grasp on your precious variables, or change their desires.</p></div>

<p>Yes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Agent with full power over Control and accurate models of Output and Stuff can negate the influence of Stuff</p>

<p>No. Control systems do not work like that.</p>
<p>All the Agent needs to know is how to vary the Output to bring the thing to be controlled towards its desired value. It need not even be aware of any of the Stuff. It might or might not be helpful, but it is not necessary. The room thermostat does not: it simply turns the heating on when the temperature is below the set point and off when it is above. It neither knows nor cares what the ambient temperature is outside, whether the sun is shining on the building, how many people are in the room, or anything at all except the sensed temperature and the reference temperature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can make the Agent's beliefs inaccurate (directly, by showing the driver a video of an upcoming hill when there is none in front of the car, or by intervening on Stuff, like introducing a gust of wind the driver can't see, and then just not updating Agent's belief).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you try to keep the speed of your car constant by deliberately compensating for the disturbances you can see, you will do a poor job of it. The Agent does not need to anticipate hills, and wind is invisible from inside a car. Instead all you have to do -- and all that an automatic cruise control does -- is measure the actual speed, compare it with the speed you want, and vary the accelerator pedal accordingly. The cruise control does not sense the gradient, head winds, tail winds, a dragging brake, or the number of passengers in the car. It doesn't need to. All it needs to do is sense the actual and desired speeds, and know how to vary the flow of fuel to bring the former closer to the latter. A simple PID controller is enough to do that.</p>
<p>This concept is <em>absolutely fundamental</em> to control systems. The controller can function, and function well, while knowing almost nothing. While you can design control systems that do -- or attempt to do -- the things you mention, sensing disturbances and computing the outputs required to counteract them, none of that is a prerequisite for control. Most control systems do without such refinements.</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>Good point. And here's a made-up parallel example to that about weight/exercise:</p>
<p>Suppose level of exercise can influence weight (E -&gt; W), and that being underfed reduces weight (U-&gt;W) directly but will also reduce the amount of exercise people do (U-&gt;E) by an amount where the effect of the reduced exercise on weight exactly cancels out the direct weight reduction.</p>
<p>Suppose also there is no random variation in amount of exercise, so it's purely a function of being underfed.</p>
<p>If we look at data generated in that situation, we would find no correlation between exercise and weight. Examining only those two variables we might assume no causal relation.</p>
<p>Adding in the third variable, would find a perfect correlation between (lack of) exercise and underfeeding. Implications of finding this perfect correlation: you can't tell if the causal relation between them should be E-&gt;U or U-&gt;E. And even if you somehow know the graph is (E-&gt;W), (U-&gt;E) and (E-&gt;W), there is no data on what happens to W for an underfed person who exercise, or a well-fed person who doesn't exercise, so you can't predict the effect of modifying E.</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>Absolutely! In a typical Bayesian network, we represent a set of probability distributions by a directed acyclic graph, such that any distribution in the set can be written as</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codecogs.com/png.latex?p[x_1,\ldots,x_n]=\prod_i%20p[x_i%20|%20pa[x_i]]" alt="" title="" /></p>
<p>in other words, for every random variable in the distribution we associate a node in the graph, and the distribution can be factorized into a product of conditional densities, where each conditional is a variable (node) conditional on variables corresponding to parents of the node.</p>
<p>This implies that <em>if</em> certain types of paths in the graph from a node set X to a node set Y are "blocked" in a particular way (e.g. d-separated) by a third set Z, then in all densities that factorize as above, X is independent of Y conditional on Z. Note that this implication is <em>one way</em>. In particular, we can still have some conditional independence that just happens to hold because the numbers in the distribution lined up just right, and the graph does not in fact advertise this independence via d-separation. When this happens, we say the distribution is <em>unfaithful</em> to the graph.</p>
<p>If we pick parameters of a distribution that factorizes at random then almost all parameter picks will be faithful to the graph. However, lots of distributions are "near unfaithful", that is they are faithful, but it's hard to tell with limited samples. Moreover, we can't tell in advance how many samples we need to tell. Also, it's easy to construct faithfulness violations and they do occur in practice. For example, we may have an AIDS drug that suppresses the HIV (so it really does help!), but the drug is very <em>nasty</em>, with lots of side effects and so on, so doctors usually wait until the patient is already very sick before giving the drug. If we then look at associations between instances of the use of this drug we may well find that those who take the drug either die more (positive association of drug with death!) or don't die less frequently than those without the drug (no association of drug with death!).</p>
<p>Does this then mean the drug has a bad effect or no effect? No! It just means there is an obvious confounder of health status that we aren't recording. In the second case, this confounder is causing the distribution over drug and death to be "unfaithful": there is an arrow from drug to death, but there is no dependence of death on drug. And yet there is still a causal effect.</p>
<hr />
<p>Note: I am glossing over some distinctions between a Bayesian network and a causal model in order to not muddy the discussion. What is important to note is that: (a) A Bayesian network is not a graphical causal model, but (b) a graphical causal model induces a Bayesian network on the observable data. Faithfulness (or lack of it) applies to the network appearing due to (b), and thus affects causal reasoning in the underlying causal model.</p></div>

<p>This seems like a big problem for inferring "no causation" from "no correlation." Is there a standard methodological solution? And, do researchers often just <em>choose</em> to infer "no causation" from "no correlation" and hope for the best, or do they avoid inferring "no causation" from "no correlation" due to the fact that they can't tell whether the faithfulness assumption holds?</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>Well, in some sense this is why causal inference is hard. Most of the time if you see independence that really does mean there is nothing there. The reasonable default is the null hypothesis: there is no causal effect. However, if you are poking around because you suspect there <em>is</em> something there, then not seeing any correlations does not mean you should give up. What it does mean is you should think about causal structure and specifically about confounders.</p>
<p>What people do about confounders is:</p>
<p>(a) Try to measure them somehow (epidemiology, medicine). If you can measure confounders you can adjust for them, and then the effect cancellation will go away.</p>
<p>(b) Try to find an instrumental variable (econometrics). If you can find a good instrument, you can get a causal effect with some parametric assumptions, even if there are unmeasured confounders.</p>
<p>(c) Try to randomize (statistics). This explicitly cuts out all confounding.</p>
<p>(d) You can sometimes get around unmeasured confounders by using strong mediating variables by means of "front-door" type methods. These methods aren't really well known, and aren't commonly used.</p>
<p>There is no royal road: getting rid of confounders is the entire point of causal inference. People have been thinking of clever ways to do it for close to a hundred years now. If you have infinite samples, and know where unobserved confounding is, there is an algorithm for getting the causal effect from observational data by being sneaky. This algorithm only succeeds sometimes, and if it doesn't, there is no other way in general to do it (e.g. it's "complete"). More in my thesis, if you are curious.</p></div>

<p>One more question, since this is your field. Do you happen to know of an instance where some new causal effect was discovered from observational data via causal modeling, and this cause was later confirmed by an RCT?</p></div>

At the end of the day, people only trust RCTs (and they are right, other methods rely on more assumptions). There is another good example, but let me double check before posting.</p>

<p>With case control studies you have the additional problem of selection bias, on top of confounding.</p></div>

<p>Your thesis deals only with acyclic causal graphs. What is the current state of the art for cyclic causal graphs? You'll know already that I've been looking at that, and I have various papers of other people that attempt to take steps in that direction, but my impression is that none of them actually get very far and there is nothing like a set of substantial results that one can point to. Even my own, were they in print yet, are primarily negative.</p></div>

<p>Quite rightly -- if we randomize, we don't care what the underlying causal structure is, we just cut all confounding out anyways. Methods (a), (b), (d) all rely on various structural assumptions that may or may not hold. However, even given those assumptions figuring out how to do causal inference from observational data is quite difficult. The problem with RCTs is expense, ethics, and statistical power (hard to enroll a ton of people in an RCT).</p>
<p>Epidemiology and medicine does a lot of (a), look for the keywords "g-formula", "g-estimation", "inverse probability weighting," "propensity score", "marginal structural models," "structural nested models", "covariate adjustment," "back-door criterion", etc. etc.</p>
<p>People talk about "controlling for other factors" when discussing associations all the time, even in non-technical press coverage. They are talking about (a).</p></div>

<p>True, true. "Gold standard" or "preferred level of evidence" versus "what's mostly conducted given the funding limitations". However, to make it into a guideline, there are often RCT follow-ups for hopeful associations uncovered by the lesser study designs.</p>

That kind of sloppy thinking just makes me think you have big blind-spots in your rationality. Maybe it's wrong, but it really has nothing to do with virtue or should-universes. To suggest otherwise is dishonest and rude. I usually don't care about rude, but this pissed me off.</p>

<p>Pretty good overall, but downvoted due to the inflammatory straw-manning of the physics diet. That kind of sloppy thinking just makes me think you have big blind-spots in your rationality.

<p>I have to admit it seemed entirely the wrong place for Eliezer to be dragging up his health issues. I find it <em>really</em> hard to keep reading a post once it starts throwing out petulant straw men. It's a shame because causality and inference is something Eliezer does probably knows something about.</p></div>

<p>This seems especially clear when there was an alarm, and we learn there was a burglar - p(B|A) = .9, so shouldn't our current p(E) go up to 0.1 * p(E|A) + p(E|~A)? Burglars burgling doesn't reduce the chance of earthquakes... Adding an alarm shouldn't change that.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The probability of Sprinkler goes up when we learn the sidewalk is Slippery, but then down -- but not below its original level -- when we learn that it is raining. (Note that the example is a little counterintuitive, in that it stipulates that Sprinkler and Rain are independent, given Season. In reality, people don't usually turn their sprinklers on when it is raining, a fact which would be represented by an arrow from Rain to Sprinkler. If that connection was added, the probability of Sprinkler would drop close to zero when Rain was observed.)</p>
<p>It's the same with Alarm/Burglar/Earthquake. The probability of Burglar and Earthquake both go up when Alarm is observed. When further observation increases the probability of Burglar, the probability of Earthquake drops, but not below its original level.</p>
<p>In the limiting case where Alarm is certain to be triggered by Burglar or Earthquake but by nothing else, and Burglar and Earthquake have independent probabilities of b and e, then hearing the Alarm raises the probability of Earthquake to e/(b+e-be). The denominator is the probability of either Burglar or Earthquake. Discovering a burglar lowers it back to e.</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>I think you've missed an important piece of this picture, or perhaps have not emphasized it as much as I would. The real real reason we can elucidate causation from correlation is that we have a prior that prefers simple explanations over complex ones, and so when some observed frequencies can be explained by a compact (simple) bayes net we take the arrows in that bayes net to be causation.</p>
<p>A fully connected bayes net (or equivalently, a causal graph with one hidden node pointing to all observed nodes) can represent <em>any</em> probability distribution whatsoever. Such a Bayes net can never be flat-out falsified. Rather it is our preference for simple explanations that sometimes gives us reason to infer structure in the world.</p>
<p>This contradicts nothing you've said, but I guess I read this article as suggesting there is some fundamental rule that gives us a crisp method for extracting causation from observations, whereas I would look at it as a special case of inference-with-prior-and-likelihood, just like in other forms of Bayesian reasoning.</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>All these conclusions seem to require simultaneity of causation. If earthquakes almost always caused recessions, but not until one year after the earthquake; and if recessions drastically increase the number of burglars, but not until one year after the recession; then drawing any of the conclusions you made from a survey taken at a single point in time would be entirely unwarranted. Doesn't that mean you’re essentially measuring <em>entailment</em> rather than causation via a series of physical events which take time to occur?</p>
<p>Also, the virtue theory of metabolism is so ridiculous that it seems only to be acting as a caricature here. Wouldn't the theory that “exercise normally metabolises fat and precursors of fat, reducing the amount of weight put on” result in a much more useful example? Or is there a subtext I'm missing here, like the excessive amount of fat-shaming done in many of the more developed nations?</p></div>

<p>I'd be more suspicious of reports that exercise <em>didn't</em> change body composition than that it did. That's how exercise tends to work for most people. I'd be more skeptical of the initial claim for net weight loss, at least if it wasn't qualified--- that is usually not what I would expect in the short term.</p>
<p>I'd be more suspicious if the 'unobservable' was a little more difficult to verify.</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>I understand your suspicion, and I don't think you're being too harsh at all. Scepticism on this point is more likely to improve understanding, after all.</p>
<p>There <em>are</em> ways to measure fat independantly of weight, however. The electrical conductance of fat and muscle differs - you can get scales that will measure both your weight and your conductance, and present you with a figure describing what percentage of your body weight is due to fat. There's also a machine at my local gym that purports to measure body fat percentage (I'm not entirely sure how it works or how accurate it is), and I have found that if I fail to exercise over a long period of time, then the figure that it measures shows a general upwards trend.</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>Having done a bit of poking around on this subject, as far as I can tell the model is more or less as follows.</p>
<p>The human body is modelled as a collection of four elements; fat, muscle, water, and bone. The percentages of these different elements can change with diet, with exercise, with different types of exercise. Bone is pretty much constant (though apparently lack of calcium can cause trouble there); water fluctuates a lot. Fat and muscle are more controllable; a given diet and exercise regimen has a target fat percentage and muscle percentage. Starting on the diet/exercise causes the body to approach the target fat/muscle percentage in some manner (it may be asymptotic). For this purpose, lack of exercise also counts as an exercise regimen, and it is one that has a high fat percentage and a low muscle percentage (so if you have been exercising and stop, you gain a fair amount of fat). There is some complicated interaction between the diet and the exercise regimen here. There may be a genetic component also affecting the model.</p>
<p>Each of these four elements - fat, muscle, water, bone - has a certain density, a certain conductivity. There are certain percentages of these elements (I do not know what they are) that would lead to an optimal health (measured as the greatest life expectancy). Given a person's height, and perhaps a few other measurements, one can estimate the total mass of bone (our skeletons are pretty much standard). From this, and given the optimal percentages, one can estimate the optimal mass of fat, of muscle, for the greatest life expectancy. (Water still fluctuates a lot, as I understand it).</p>
<p>Measurements of these percentages include weight, girth, electrical conductivity, and use of calipers. The first three of these figures measure quantities that are affected by all four percentages; a change in one factor can be masked by a change in the others.</p>
<p>All in all, it's a far more complex problem than it looks like at first glance. Some heuristics have leaked out into common knowledge; things like "don't eat too much fatty foods" and "exercise at least a bit". I am not sure how accurate these heuristics are - presumably there is some reasoning backing them, possibly based on the model vaguely described above. I also suspect that the idea of the ideal weight (based on BMI) is based on the expectation of a certain common maximum muscle percentage.</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>Having muscle substituted for fat would result in better health or at least greater strength, I would think. Weight is (usually) just an easy way to measure a change in fat. I am trying successfully to lose more weight based on the assumption that the conditions for fat to form or persist depend largely on the balance of food intake and amount of exercise. If you maintain a consistent food intake, and maintain a consistent amount of exercise, and gain fat, then if it is physically safe to, either reduce food intake, or increase exercise. If given your current diet, and you slightly increase your exercise, you have proven that you do not lose fat, then I would assume that you should try changing the variables more, instead of giving up. We're not exactly spending all day hunting and gathering anymore. I am going to increase my exercise and decrease my food (although I still invest in daily chocolate lifestyle enhancement, as you suggested as a sure bet as opposed to playing the lottery), and I am fairly sure before two weeks pass I will have lost five pounds.</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>Sorry for the delay, I got caught up in the Halloween spirit.
As for the following table, it lists the date and recorded weight on that date.</p>
<ul>
<li>10/13--149.0 (lb.)</li>
<li>10/14--149.9</li>
<li>10/15--149.5</li>
<li>10/16--151.2</li>
<li>10/17--151.9</li>
<li>10/18--149.7</li>
<li>10/20--151.0</li>
<li>10/21--151.2</li>
<li>10/22--149.3</li>
<li>10/23--148.4</li>
<li>10/24--148.2</li>
<li>10/25--146.8</li>
<li>10/26--147.3</li>
<li>10/27--146.4</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, I did not reach the goal that I set. The excuse--er, explanation, is that I made that claim on the very day I started a week-long vacation. Hence, I was much more sedentary than while working, and I ate more frequent and larger meals than on workdays. October 22 was the day I returned to work, and was also the day that I actually began losing weight, so my 2-week prediction actually had about a week cut off, and (anecdotally) shows both sides of the story in doing so. On the upside, I progressed pretty far in Paper Mario. If I had started the two weeks from the 22nd, I have lost about 7lb. since then. Hopefully this provides some data for anyone interested.</p></div>

<p>has me puzzled. The variables used aren't explicitly mentioned elsewhere in the article, and while I think they have some conventional meaning I can't quiet remember what. The context let me make a decent guess, but I still feel a little fuzzy.
Otherwise the post was pretty clear, much clearer than the other explanations I've seen.</p></div>

<p>Tpyos:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Shortly after the sentence, "We could consider three hypothetical causal
diagrams over only these two variables", one of the "Earthquake --&gt;
Recession" tables gives p(¬e) as 0.70 when it should be 0.71 (so it and 0.29
sum to one).</p></li>
<li><p>After the sentence, "So since all three variables are correlated, can we
distinguish between, say, these three causal models?", <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/mediawiki/images/6/6c/EY16.svg">this
diagram</a> I think is
meant to have "Recession" on top and "Burglar" on the bottom. (<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/ev3/causal_diagrams_and_causal_models/7m6j">Vaniver also
noticed this
one.</a>)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The paragraph that starts with "Sure! First, we <em>marginalize</em> over the
'exercise' variable to get the table for just weight and Internet use" needs
to have <code>s/normal-weight/overweight/</code> run on it. (And maybe have a sentence
added saying that you're getting the rest of the following table by doing the
same math on the other three sets of people grouped by weight and Internet
usage.)</li>

<div class="md"><p>Causal networks have another name in computer science, in the context of compilers. They're the dataflow diagrams of loop-free array-free non-recursive functions represented in SSA form. (Functions that contain loops, arrays and recursion can still be reasoned about with causal networks, but only locally - you have to unroll everything, and that blows up quickly if you try to do it globally.)</p>
<p>A dataflow diagram is when you give each variable in a function a node, and draw an edge from the variable to each of the other variables that was used in its definition. SSA form is when you write a function in such a way that every variable is assigned to exactly once - ie, you can't give a var a value, use it, then give it a new value. Compilers automatically translate functions to SSA form by giving unique names to all the assignments, and defining a new variable (conventionally marked with a combination function phi) at each point where one of several of those names would be chosen based on branch conditions. Compilers use this form because it makes it easier to check which optimizations and transforms are valid before applying them.</p></div>

<p>One option is to make a much larger causal diagram that has variables recessions(t), burglars(t), and alarms(t) where t is a (say discrete) time variable, then have recessions(t) cause burglars(t+1), burglars(t) disabling alarms(t+1), and alarms(t) causing recessions(t+1).</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>A few minor clarity/readability points:</p>
<ol>
<li>The second paragraph opening "The statisticians who discovered the nature of reality" reads rather oddly when taken out of the context of "The Fabric of Real Things".</li>
<li>When considering the three causal models of Burglars, Alarms and Recessions, tackling the models in a "First, third, second" order threw me on first reading. It would probably be easier to follow if the text and the diagram used the same order.</li>
<li>Perhaps giving each node a different pastel colour would make it easier to follow what is changing between different diagrams.</li>
</ol>
<p>And this has probably been said, but using exercise and weight is probably distracting, since people already have opinions on the issue.</p>
<p><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/3y/support_that_sounds_like_dissent/">All in all though, a great article</a>.</p></div>

<p>I am extremely skeptical of this portion, it would imply that Eliezer's body functions differently then literally every other person (myself included) I have ever known to make a serious attempt at working out.. 2 Hours 3 times a week? How long did you try this?</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>The fact that people respond to exercise differently to weight training and exercise non uniformly depending on their genetics and other factors is no big surprise. But showing <em>no gains</em> at all is something altogether.</p>
<p>I can think of several questions I would ask about the study you linked. For example: "In the combined strength-and-endurance-exercise program, the volunteers’ physiological improvement ranged from a negative 8 percent (meaning they became 8 percent less fit) " implies to me that the researchers didn't control for a host of other factors.</p>
<p>Anecdotes ARE data. Especially a life time of several of them all accumulating in one way.</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>Since you seem to have forgotten what you were arguing, let us review. Eliezer wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I saw no discernible effect on my weight or my musculature from aerobic exercise and strength training 2 hours a day 3 times a week</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it would imply that Eliezer's body functions differently then literally every other person (myself included) I have ever known</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And implied it must be impossible, hence Eliezer must be doing something wrong.</p>
<p>I linked a study showing that people 'doing it right' could see their fitness <em>go down</em>, empirically refuting your universalizing claim that "every other person (myself included)" would see their fitness only go up.</p>
<p>You then tried to wave away the <em>study</em> by a fully general counter-argument appealing to other factors explaining why some people could see their fitness decrease... But neither I nor Eliezer ever made an argument about what <em>caused</em> the exercise resistance, merely that some people would empirically see their fitness decrease or remain stable.</p>
<p>When I pointed this out, you smarmily replied about how I'm being unfair to you and strawmanning you, and implied that I hold theories of exercise as "magic".</p>
<p>Personally, I see no need to construct any 'ironmanning' of your position, since you do not yet seem to have understood that what we were saying was limited to questions of fact and not speculation about what might explain said observed fact. (What, exactly, is the ironmanning of a fact - as opposed to a theory or paradigm?)</p></div>

<p>If someone gets sick (for example) towards the end of the study and then shows a "negative 8 percent " fitness level then their data is crap.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And they could have been sick at the <em>start</em>, as well, producing pseudo gains... You're postulating things which you have no reason to think happened to explain things that did happen; nowhere is anything indicated about that and you are arguing solely that because you dislike the results, the researchers were incompetent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the study did not control for intensity then it is crap.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why should there be any control for intensity? They did an intervention; there should be a non-zero effect. If any level of exercise does not show any benefits, then you are wrong. And I guess you did not read the link, because several interventions were tested and did not show any difference in terms of exercise resistance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The study had an age range from 40 and 67...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So? Why do you think that exercise should be entirely ineffective in people age 67? Are 40yos from a different species where exercise does not work? By examining older people, who are much less fit and much more sedentary, shouldn't the effects be even more dramatic and visible?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This study is garbage.</p>

<p>So, in addition to "Individual responses to combined endurance and strength training in older adults", Karavirta 2011, let me also cite <a href="http://ajpendo.physiology.org/content/288/6/E1168.short" rel="nofollow">&quot;Endurance training-induced changes in insulin sensitivity and gene expression&quot;</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/7ki7s8mtjyj6it1/2001-bouchard.pdf" rel="nofollow">&quot;Individual differences in response to regular physical activity&quot;</a>, "Effects of Exercise Training on Glucose Homeostasis: The HERITAGE Family Study", <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0037887" rel="nofollow">&quot;Adverse Metabolic Response to Regular Exercise: Is It a Rare or Common Occurrence?&quot;</a>, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/expphysiol.2011.058735/full" rel="nofollow">&quot;Genomic predictors of trainability&quot;</a>, <a href="http://jap.physiology.org/content/71/5/2004.short" rel="nofollow">&quot;Effects of gender, age, and fitness level on response of  vo2max to training in 60–71 yr olds&quot;</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3696411/" rel="nofollow">&quot;Resistance to exercise-induced weight loss: compensatory behavioral adaptations&quot;</a>, and "Cardiovascular autonomic function correlates with the response to aerobic training in healthy sedentary subjects", to name a few. (One nice thing about HERITAGE and Bouchard's earlier studies is that they recorded exercise, so spare me the 'maybe they didn't actually exercise'.) In these, too, some people don't benefit from exercise and show individual differences in exercise trainability exist.</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>The context was whether exercise resistance was a thing that existed (and hence, whether it was something Eliezer could have). I was revisiting my old comments on the topic to grab the citations I had dug up as part of working on a section for my longevity cost-benefit analysis where I observe that given the phenomenon of exercise resistance, behavioral backlash like lowering basal activity levels, and twin studies indicating various exercise correlations are partially genetically confounded, we should be genuinely doubtful about how much exercise will help with non-athletic or cosmetic things and be demanding randomized trials.</p></div>

<p>A lack of strength increase would be particularly weird. I thought the subject was weight and body composition.

<p>That would imply that he has a neurological disorder that impairs motor function only up to the extent that it prevents performances to improve past the requirements of a sedentary lifestyle, but not to the extent to cause actual disability. Is anything like this documented in medical literature?</p>
<blockquote>

<p>It seems to me that Yudkowsky is quite prone to rationalization: he might have started to train, didn't particularly like it and when he didn't get the results he hoped for, instead of revising his training program or keep training for a longer time, he came up with the weird genetic condition as an excuse to quit.
At least, this explanation appears to be more likely than the hypothesis that he actually has a weird genetic condition unknown to science, AFAIK.</p></div>

<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>This "observe the results of a scientist's controlled study" thought experiment motivates and provides hope that one can sometimes derive causation from observation,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed; one way to think about this is to consider nature as a scientist whose shoulder we can look over.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>where the current story arc makes a sortof magical leap.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The leap only seems magical until you understand what the moving parts inside are. So let's try going in the reverse direction, and see if that helps make it clearer.</p>
<p>Suppose there are three binary variables, A, B, and C, and they are pairwise dependent on each other: that is, P(A) isn't P(A|B), but we haven't looked at P(A|BC).</p>
<p>Alice says that A causes both B and C. Bob says that A causes B, which causes C. Charlie says that A and B both cause C. (Each of these is a minimal description of the model- any arcs not mentioned don't exist, which means there's no direct causal link between those two.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, A, B, and C are easy to measure but hard to influence, so running experiments is out of the question, but fortunately we have lots of observational data to do statistics on.</p>
<p>We take a look at the models and realize that they make <em>falsifiable predictions</em>:</p>
<p>If Alice is right, then B and C should be conditionally independent given A: that is, P(B|AC)=P(B|A) and P(C|AB)=P(C|A).</p>
<p>If Bob is right, then A and C should be conditionally independent given B: that is, P(A|BC)=P(A|B) and P(C|AB)=P(C|B).</p>
<p>If Charlie is right, then A and B should be independent, and only become dependent given C.</p>
<p>We know Charlie's wrong immediately, since the variables are unconditionally pairwise dependent. To test if Alice or Bob are right, we look at the joint probability distribution and marginalize, like described in the post. Suppose we find that both Alice and Bob are wrong, and so we can conclude that their models are incorrect, just like we could with Charlie's.</p>
<p>In general, we don't look at three proposed models. What we do instead is a procedure that will implicitly consider each of the 25 acyclic causal models that <em>could</em> describe a set of three binary variables, ruling them out until only a small set are left.</p>
<p>Note that an observation that, say, A and C are uncorrelated given B ensured that there is no arc between A and C- ruling out around two thirds of the models at once; that's what we mean by implicitly considering all models. As well, we're left with a <em>set</em> of models that agree with the data- sometimes, we'll be able to reduce it to a single model, but sometimes the data is insufficient to identify the model exactly, and so we'll have several models which are all possible- but many more models which we know can't be the case.</p>
<p>That's the big insight, I think: causal models make testable predictions, and most imaginable models will be wrong. My suspicion as to why this took so long to develop is that it's worthless when looking at graphs with only two nodes (apparently not; see <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/ev3/causal_diagrams_and_causal_models/7mja">this comment below</a>): there, we can only tell the difference between independence and correlation, and there's no way to tell which way the causation goes. It's only when we have systems with at least three nodes that we start being able to rule out causal models, and the third node may let us conclude things about the first two nodes that we couldn't conclude without that node.</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>Yes, but they contain less information. Check out figure 2 of the Peters paper (which describes discrete distributions). If you have an additive noise model, so Y is X plus noise, then by looking at the joint pdf you can distinguish between X causing Y and Y causing X by the corners. This doesn't seem possible if X and Y can only have 2 values (since you get a square, not a trapezoid).</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>This helped me understand what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_variable" rel="nofollow">Instrumental Variables</a> are, but Andrew Gelman's <a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2009/07/how_to_think_ab_2/" rel="nofollow">critique of instrumental variables</a> has me confused again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose z is your instrument, T is your treatment, and y is your outcome. So the causal model is z -&gt; T -&gt; y. The trick is to think of (T,y) as a joint outcome and to think of the effect of z on each. For example, an increase of 1 in z is associated with an increase of 0.8 in T and an increase of 10 in y. The usual “instrumental variables” summary is to just say the estimated effect of T on y is 10/0.8=12.5, but I’d rather just keep it separate and report the effects on T and y separately.</p>
<p>In Piero’s example, this translates into two statements: (a) States with higher penalties for murder had higher penalties for defamation, and (b) States with higher penalties for murder had less reporting of corruption.</p>
<p>Fine. But I don’t see how this adds anything at all to my understanding of the defamation/corruption relationship, beyond what I learned from his simpler finding: States with higher penalties for defamation had less reporting of corruption.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If your model is z -&gt; T -&gt; y, and you show that z interacts with each of T and y, isn't the next step just to look at the relation between z and y, controlling for T? In other words, if it turns out that z still matters in predicting y once you have T in your model, then you don't have an instrumental variable. But if T screens off the effect of z in predicting y, then z is an instrumental variable, and only affects y through T.</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>Interesting article, thanks.</p>
<p>I agree with the general concept. I would be a bit more careful in the conclusions, however: <br />
No visible correlation does not mean no causation - it is just a strong hint. In the specific example, the hint comes from a single parameter - the lack of significant correlation between internet &amp; overweight when both exercise categories are added; together with the significant correlation of internet usage with the other two parameters.</p>
<p>With the proposed diagram, I get: <br />
p(Internet)=.141 <br />
p(not Internet)=.859 <br />
p(Overweight)=.209 <br />
p(not Overweight)=.791</p>
<p>p(Ex|Int &amp; Ov)=.10 <br />
p(Ex|Int &amp; no OV)=.62 <br />
p(Ex|no Int &amp; Ov)=.27 <br />
p(Ex|no Int &amp; no Ov)=.85</p>
<p>This model has 6 free parameters - the insignificant correlation between overweight and internet is the only constraint. It is true that other models have to be more complex to explain data, but we know that our world is not a small toy simulation - there are causal connections everywhere, the question is just "are they negligible or not?".</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>I haven't read enough of Causality, but I think I get how to find a causal model from the examples above.</p>
<p>Basically, a model selection problem? P(Model|Data) = P(Data|Model)P(Model)/P(Data) ~ P(Data|Model)P(Model)?</p>
<p>Is P(Model) done in some objective sense, or is that left to the prior of the modeler? Or some combination of contextually objective and standard causal modeling priors (direction of time, locality, etc.)?</p>
<p>Any good powerpoint summary of Pearl's methods out there?</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>P(Model) is usually related to the dimension of the model (number of parameters). The more parameters, the less likely the model (a form of the razor we all know and love).</p>
<p>See these:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_information_criterion" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_information_criterion</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion</a></p>
<p>There are other ways of learning causal structure, based on ruling out graphs not consistent with constraints found in the data. These do not rely on priors, but have their own problems.</p></div>

<p>An earthquake is 0.8 likely to set off your burglar alarm; a burglar is 0.9 likely to set off your burglar alarm. And - we can't compute this model fully without this info - the combination of a burglar and an earthquake is 0.95 likely to set off the alarm;</p>

<p>I don't think that true. The earthquake can cause the burgler to have less control over his own movement and therefore increase the chance that he triggers the alarm.</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>I've been enjoying this series so far, and I found this article to be particularly helpful. I did have a minor suggestion. The turnstile and the logical negation symbols were called out, and I thought it might be useful to explicitly breakdown the probability distribution equation. The current Less Wrong audience had little problem with it, certainly, but if you were showing it to someone new to this for the first time, they might not be acquainted with it. I was thinking something along the lines of this from stattrek:</p>
<p>"Generally, statisticians use a capital letter to represent a random variable and a lower-case letter, to represent one of its values. For example,</p>
<pre><code>X represents the random variable X.
P(X) represents the probability of X.
P(X = x) refers to the probability that the random variable X is equal to a particular value, denoted by x. As an example, P(X = 1) refers to the probability that the random variable X is equal to 1."
</code></pre>
<p>(from <a href="http://stattrek.com/probability-distributions/probability-distribution.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://stattrek.com/probability-distributions/probability-distribution.aspx</a>)</p>
<p>Also, page 2 of A Student's Guide to Maxwell's Equations does a great job of diagramming Gauss' law for electrical fields, and I think it would be helpful if this were available to breakdown the right half of the equation, with the beginning reader seeing a breakdown of the equation.</p>
<p><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=I-x1MLny6y8C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?id=I-x1MLny6y8C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false</a></p>
<p>If this all was set aside in the footnote, the overall continuity of the article wouldn't be affected, and someone who might be intimidated at first by equations might see that these aren't so bad. With just a bit of exposition, more readers might be able to follow along with the entire argument, which I think could be introduced to someone with very little background.</p></div>

<div class="md"><p>This was a really good article overall; I just finished going through all the numbers in Excel and it makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>The thing that is most counterintuitive to me is that it appears that the causal link between exercise and weight can ONLY be computed if you bring in a 3rd, seemingly irrelevant variable like internet usage. It looks like that variable has to be somehow correlated with at least one of the causal nodes - maybe it has to be correlated with one specific node... I am a little hazy on that.</p>
<p>I encourage readers to open an Excel file or something and, using Eliezer's made-up 'data' about exercise/weight/internet, exhaustively list all the possible causal graphs for those 3 variables, then falsify all of them until only the one remains. It really shows how nicely the technique works.</p>
<p>Now I am keen to find some controversial real-world causal hypothesis and test it using this method.</p></div>
